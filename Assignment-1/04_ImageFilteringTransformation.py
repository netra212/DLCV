# Image Filtering and Transformation.
# Task: Implement a function to perform image Filtering and Transformation that includes:
# 1. Filtering: Apply a Gaussian blur to the image to reduce noise and smooth the image. 
# 2. Transformation: Apply a rotation to the image by a specified angle. 

# For Gaussian blur, you can create a Gaussian kernel and apply it using convolution: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_blur
# For rotation, compute the rotation matrix and use cv2.warpAffine: https://theailearner.com/tag/cv2-warpaffine/

# G(x,y) = 1/2*PI*Sigma^2 * exp(- x^2 + y^2/2*sigma^2)
